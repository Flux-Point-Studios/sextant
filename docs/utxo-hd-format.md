# The Mithril cardano-database ancillary — InMemory UTxO-HD format (as observed)

The concrete format T3 bootstraps from, established by unpacking a real preprod ancillary
(epoch 300, immutable 5936, cardano-node **11.0.1**). This is the "spec by observation" that
T3-parse promotes to "spec by transcription": the exact key/value encoding is confirmed against
the ouroboros-consensus encoder for the pinned node version, and the parser hard-fails any codec
version it was not written against.

## Archive layout (`ancillary.tar.zst`)

756 MB compressed / 1.88 GB uncompressed, unpacked by `tools/snapshot`:

```
ancillary_manifest.json                 984 B   file→SHA-256 digests + Ed25519 signature
immutable/05937.{chunk,primary,secondary}       the last immutable chunk (small)
ledger/<slot>/meta                       69 B   backend + codec version (JSON)
ledger/<slot>/state                    ~31 MB   ExtLedgerState WITHOUT the UTxO tables
ledger/<slot>/tables                  ~909 MB   the UTxO map  ← the only file T3-parse reads
```

Two ledger snapshots ship (two consecutive slots); the parser takes the newer, whose slot is
S. **The UTxO map is a SEPARATE file (`tables`)** from the rest of the ledger state (`state`) —
so T3-parse decodes `tables` directly and never navigates `ExtLedgerState`. That is the amendment
"navigate past the rest of ExtLedgerState": there is nothing to navigate.

## `meta` — the version gate

```json
{"backend":"utxohd-mem","checksum":4044459344,"tablesCodecVersion":1}
```

T3-parse **asserts** `backend == "utxohd-mem"` (the InMemory flavor — the only one Mithril ships,
since cardano-node v10.4.1) and pins `tablesCodecVersion == 1`. Any other value fails closed
(a mutant that bumps the version asserts refusal) — the churn guard the fork required.

## `tables` — the UTxO map (`tablesCodecVersion` 1)

A single-element array wrapping an indefinite CBOR map of `bytes → bytes`:

```
81                      array(1)
  bf                    map(indefinite)
    58 22 <34 bytes>    key   = TxIn  : tx_id (32) ‖ big-endian u16 index
    59 xxxx <N bytes>   value = TxOut : serialized output (NOT needed for membership)
    …                   (entries are SORTED by key)
    ff                  break
```

The 34-byte key is **byte-identical to `RedbUtxoStore`'s own outpoint key** (`tx_id ‖ BE u16`,
the commitment-note §5.1 shape), verified on the real file: entries 0 and 1 share a `tx_id` with
index `0x0000` then `0x0001`, and the map's leading keys begin with low `tx_id` bytes because it
is sorted. For the Tier-2 **membership** set the parser reads ONLY the keys — each 34-byte key is
an `OutPoint`; the `TxOut` value is skipped (a consumer needing the output content pairs it with a
CardanoTransactions inclusion proof, per commitment-note §5.2).

## T3-verify — the trust gate (the `AncillarySigned` basis, made real)

Before any byte is parsed, the ancillary manifest is verified — this is what the `AncillarySigned`
anchor basis (utxoset.rs) actually rests on, no longer merely asserted. `snapshot-parse
<ancillary-dir> <preprod|mainnet>` runs the full chain via `verify_newest_tables`:

1. **Manifest signature** (core `ancillary::verify_ancillary_manifest`): `compute_hash` = SHA-256
   over each `(path ‖ hex-digest)` of the manifest's sorted map, then Ed25519 `verify_strict`
   under the **pinned per-network ancillary key** (`ANCILLARY_VKEY_PREPROD` /
   `ANCILLARY_VKEY_MAINNET`, decoded from `mithril-infra/configuration/<net>/ancillary.vkey`).
   This is a SINGLE IOG key — a different trust class from the STM stake-quorum certification of
   the immutable blocks, which is exactly why it is surfaced as its own basis.
2. **File digests**: the on-disk `tables` and `meta` files must SHA-256 to the digests that
   signature commits, or the gate fails closed — no `tables` handle is issued.
3. **Codec gate**: `meta` must be `backend=utxohd-mem` + `tablesCodecVersion=1`.

Verified end-to-end on the real preprod snapshot: signature OK under the pinned key, the real
909 MB `tables` hashes to the signed digest `d1d2288f…`, and only then does the parse run.

## T3-parse — the decode, and its verification oracles

`tools/snapshot`'s `tables` module parses the (now trust-established) bytes on Sextant's own
minicbor path. On the real preprod snapshot it decodes **4,176,148 outpoints** (memory-mapped,
streamed — the set is never materialized), enforcing the strictly-increasing key invariant so a
reordered/duplicate tamper also fails closed.

1. **Manifest-signature independence — DONE.** See T3-verify above: the parsed bytes are pinned by
   IOG's Ed25519 signature over the SHA-256 digest of this exact file.
2. **Cheap independence — DONE.** Koios spot-samples: the first parsed outpoints all exist on
   preprod and are `is_spent=false` — consistent with membership at S (unspent-now ⇒ unspent-at-S).
3. **Definitive, one-time — PENDING (needs a node).** Load this exact snapshot in a cardano-node
   11.0.1, `query utxo --whole-utxo`, and golden the full-UTxO-set hash against the parser's.
4. **Substrate cross-check — the discharge audit.** The subset-consistency check against
   `extract_block_effects` over a certified window ending at S — the incremental audit that
   discharges `AncillarySigned → StmCertified`.

## T3-load — the certified set, persisted and queryable

`snapshot-load <ancillary-dir> <network> <redb-path>` verifies the manifest, streams the verified
outpoints into an on-disk `RedbUtxoStore` (`bulk_insert`: one atomic write transaction), and leaves
a persisted membership set tagged with slot S and the `AncillarySigned` basis. On the real preprod
snapshot it loads all **4,176,148** outpoints (~540 MB redb) and answers "is this outpoint in the
certified set at S?" — a real snapshot outpoint reads present, a fabricated one absent.

**The tip is the T3→T4 seam, not derivable from the ancillary.** Binding the set to a concrete tip
block (hash + number at S) needs S's block, and it is *not* in the ancillary: the bundled
`immutable/<n>.chunk` is Mithril's "last immutable file" — a LATER, unrelated chunk (observed: its
blocks are at slots 128239242–128239523, all *after* the ledger snapshot at 128237957, with a gap),
and S's own block lives in an earlier immutable chunk that ships only with the full cardano-database.
The ledger `state` file does carry the tip, but buried inside the ExtLedgerState the amended plan
declines to parse. So T4 resolves S→block against the certified chain it must reach anyway, then
seeds a `UtxoSet` at that tip from this store (`UtxoSet::with_store`).

## Committed fixtures

`tests/vectors/utxohd-meta.json` and `tests/vectors/utxohd-ancillary-manifest.json` are the real
(tiny) meta + manifest, so the version gate and the T3-verify digest/signature checks are testable
offline. The 909 MB `tables` blob is not committed; T3-parse's full differential runs against a
locally-fetched snapshot, and a small hand-built valid sub-map fixtures the parse shape in CI.
