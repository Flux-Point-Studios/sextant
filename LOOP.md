# LOOP: Sextant — read-path verifying Cardano client (Rust core, C-ABI/WASM trust substrate)

STATUS: ACTIVE

## Definition of Done
Every line must be provably true, with the proof named. The Stop gate and
the outer loop only trust `scripts/harness.sh --full`; everything else
needs a row in Evidence.

- [ ] `scripts/harness.sh --full` exits 0
- [ ] Header validation: decodes current-era headers and verifies leader
      VRF + KES against ≥20 golden vectors pulled from preview and
      mainnet, byte-identical verdicts to pallas on the same inputs —
      proof: named differential test run in harness output
- [x] Chain following: validates a stored preview header sequence across
      an epoch boundary, including nonce evolution — proof: test run
      naming the epoch and the evolved nonce value
      (PROVEN on preprod — the operator-chosen testnet for this whole client,
      per Plan; `tests/boundary.rs::boundary_run_crosses_epoch_299_to_300_and_
      the_nonce_evolved` follows a stored contiguous run across the 299→300 turn
      and names the evolved η0(300) = `aa845533…4eeb6c30`, with each side's
      leader-VRF bound to its own epoch nonce and rejecting the other's)
- [x] Mithril: verifies a genesis-anchored certificate chain fetched from
      the network aggregator — proof: test naming the certificate hash
      (PROVEN on release-preprod; `tests/mithril.rs::real_preprod_genesis_anchored_
      chain_verifies` runs `mithril::verify_chain_anchored` over the real segment
      rooted in the epoch-196 re-genesis, naming the tip cert hash
      `fc979366…f2d56b72` and the genesis root `69bc3bdf…af7ad59`; the composed
      verifier requires the root be a genesis-key-signed anchor, each rising cert's
      STM multi-signature, and the hash-link + AVK-binding + integrity between them)
- [ ] UTxO verification for the read path designed and
      implemented (snapshot-anchored or proof-based — decide in a design
      slice first), with a negative test proving a tampered UTxO claim is
      rejected — proof: named test
- [ ] Artifacts: single static lib + C header via cbindgen, and a wasm32
      build, both produced in CI — proof: release workflow run link
- [ ] Live: the first downstream consumer's execution path performs one
      verified UTxO read on preview against a real order before a spend
      decision, and rejects a spoofed RPC response in the same test —
      proof: service log excerpt + the UTxO ref
- [ ] Diff carries no single-caller abstractions and no dead code

## Plan
- [x] Failing test: decode one current-era header from a checked-in CBOR
      vector; assert slot, block number, issuer vkey
- [x] Vector-set differential harness: every `tests/vectors/*.block` is
      decoded on Sextant's own path and cross-checked against pallas
      (block_number/slot/issuer_vkey), the validated era is surfaced on
      `HeaderView`, and cross-era coverage is asserted — the scaling
      primitive for the ≥20-vector requirement (harvested vectors are
      auto-verified here or the harness goes red; vectors are inputs to
      verify, never trusted state)
- [x] Vector harvester + live pull: `tools/harvest` (workspace member) pulls
      recent preprod block CBOR off a public relay (pallas-network N2N
      BlockFetch; points from Koios) into tests/vectors/. 22 preprod (era 7)
      + 5 mainnet golden (era 6/7) = 27 vectors, each byte-identical to pallas
      via the sweep. Note: preprod, not preview, per operator choice.
- [x] VRF output verification: extract vrf_vkey + vrf_result (output/proof)
      from the header and recompute the 64-byte VRF output (beta) via
      draft-03 `proof_to_hash` (SHA512 over 8·Gamma, on cryptoxide's
      curve25519) on Sextant's own path — byte-identical to every one of the
      27 real vectors' on-chain output. Nonce-independent, so no epoch nonce
      needed. Oracle is the canonical libsodium producer (cardano-node), not
      pallas: pallas-crypto 1.1.1 (latest published) ships no VRF module.
- [x] Full leader-VRF verify: `hash_to_curve` (Elligator2) + challenge +
      equation, binding the proof to `alpha = Blake2b256(slot_be8 || eta0)`;
      accept a real vector (eta0 = Koios `epoch_params?_epoch_no=N`, N = the
      block's epoch) and reject a tampered proof. Done: eta0 backfilled as
      `.eta0` sidecars via `cargo run -p harvest eta0`; `vrf::verify` composes
      Amaru's elligator-fixed `curve25519-dalek` fork on Sextant's own draft-03
      orchestration; all 22 real preprod proofs verify, verdict cross-checked
      against the independent non-dalek `cardano-crypto` oracle, tampered
      slot/nonce/key/scalar all rejected.
- [x] Operational-certificate verification: decode the opcert (header_body idx
      8 = `[hot_vkey, seq, kes_period, sigma]`) and verify the cold key
      (`issuer_vkey`) Ed25519-signed `hot_vkey ‖ BE64(seq) ‖ BE64(kes_period)`
      (cardano-ledger OCertSignable) on Sextant's own path. `src/ed25519.rs`
      matches libsodium's strict cofactorless boundary (canonical `S<L`,
      canonical non-small-order `A`); the canonical point-decode is extracted to
      `src/curve.rs` (shared with vrf). All 22 real preprod opcerts verify
      (cardano-node ground truth), verdict byte-identical to pallas-crypto's
      independent `cryptoxide` backend; tamper / `s+L` malleation /
      malformed-CBOR all rejected. PR #5.
- [x] KES body-signature verification (the other half of DoD line 2): the
      header's `body_signature` (header idx 1) is a `Sum6Kes` signature over the
      raw header_body bytes at period `slot/129600 − opcert.kes_period`. Verified
      recursively on the existing ed25519 substrate (Blake2b256 vk-hash tree,
      Sum0 = Ed25519 leaf, 448-byte sig) on Sextant's own path in `src/kes.rs`
      (`verify_kes` / `verify_header_kes`); the decoder now captures the raw
      header_body span + the 448-byte body_signature on `HeaderView`. All 22 real
      preprod body signatures verify (cardano-node ground truth, periods 0..35),
      verdict byte-identical to pallas-crypto's independent `Sum6Kes`; tampered
      sig/vk-node/root-key/message/period and out-of-range/underflow periods all
      rejected. `blake2b256` extracted to `src/hash.rs` (shared with vrf). No new
      crate in the trust-substrate normal graph (pallas `kes` feature is dev-only).
      DoD line 2 assessment recorded in Notes (KES + leader-VRF proven on ≥20 real
      preprod; a full "from mainnet" tick needs a real-mainnet harvest with eta0).
- [x] Nonce-evolution FORMULA (DoD line 3, part 1 of 3): `src/nonce.rs`
      implements the Praos `⭒` combine (`Blake2b256(a‖b)`), the per-block
      contribution `Blake2b256(Blake2b256(0x4E ‖ vrf_output))` (double hash +
      domain tag — the Praos trap the legacy TPraos rolling nonce omits), the
      rolling fold `η_v' = η_v ⭒ contribution`, and the epoch-boundary combine
      `η0 = candidate ⭒ prevHashNonce (⭒ extraEntropy)` on Sextant's own path.
      Differentially proven byte-exact against pallas-crypto's independent
      implementation: the `test_epoch_nonce` golden pins `epoch_nonce`/`⭒`, the
      `test_rolling_nonce` golden (30-block shelley-seed fold) pins `⭒` + fold
      chaining, and on all 22 real preprod VRF outputs `evolve` matches pallas's
      `generate_rolling_nonce` oracle (fed the test-assembled extended input, so
      non-circular). Formula only — the prevHashNonce header-hash retag, the
      candidate-freeze window, and folding a real epoch are chain-data slices
      (parts 2 + 3), deliberately not claimed here.
- [x] Chain-following over the stored contiguous preprod run (DoD line 3,
      part 2 of 3): `src/chain.rs` `verify_segment(blocks, eta0)` composes the
      Blake2b256 header link (`prev_hash == parent.block_hash`) with the full
      per-header crypto (opcert → leader-VRF vs the epoch nonce → KES) already
      proven per-vector. The 22 preprod vectors were BlockFetched as one range,
      so they are one unbroken epoch-300 segment (block numbers 4921916..=4921937);
      `HeaderView` now surfaces `prev_hash` + `block_hash`, both byte-identical to
      pallas. Positive: the stored run verifies end-to-end against its named nonce
      and Sextant's decoded fields witness +1 block numbers / strictly-increasing
      slots. Negative: reorder / drop / splice → `BrokenLink`; per-field tamper →
      the matching opcert/VRF/KES failure at that block; wrong epoch nonce →
      leader-VRF rejects block 0; malformed block → `Decode` at its index. No
      harvest needed — the harvested range was already contiguous.
- [x] REAL BOUNDARY (DoD line 3, part 3 of 3 — closes the DoD line): `tools/harvest
      boundary` BlockFetched a contiguous 10-block preprod run across the 299→300
      turn (slots 127958330..=127958607; turn at 127958489) into `boundary-*.block`
      + per-epoch `.eta0` sidecars. `tests/boundary.rs` splits the run at its single
      nonce switch and, reusing `chain::verify_segment` once per side, verifies each
      block's leader-VRF against ITS epoch η0 (pre → η0(299) `9adf4f5b…f4e0b2`, post
      → η0(300) `aa845533…4eeb6c30`), proves the boundary links by hash (last-299
      `block_hash` == first-300 `prev_hash`, +1 height) and that swapping in the
      WRONG epoch's nonce makes leader-VRF reject at block 0 on BOTH sides — the
      on-chain proof η0 evolved. No lib change: the per-epoch nonce switch is a
      test-level composition of the existing primitive. `boundary-` prefix keeps
      these out of part 2's single-epoch preprod sweep; the all-`*.block`
      decode/VRF sweeps auto-verify them against pallas.
- [x] Mithril certificate hashing (DoD line 4, part 1 of N): `src/mithril.rs`
      (behind an OFF-by-default `mithril` cargo feature so the wasm/default lib
      graph stays lean) defines the certificate entity structs and the byte-exact
      SHA-256 `compute_hash` fns (ProtocolParameters U8F24 `phi_f`, metadata
      RFC3339-nanos, ProtocolMessage in enum order, Certificate feeding the wire
      avk/multi_sig strings directly). Harvest a real preprod certificate segment
      (`tools/harvest mithril`, aggregator `release-preprod`) as JSON vectors;
      prove `Certificate::compute_hash` == the aggregator's own `hash` on every
      vector and that each cert's `previous_hash` == its parent vector's computed
      hash (self-authenticating chain links), plus the golden `phi_f=0.7 ->
      11744051`, verdict byte-identical to `mithril-common`'s hasher. Signature
      verification (genesis Ed25519 anchor, STM multi-sig, AVK binding, full
      chain-walk to genesis) are the subsequent Mithril slices.
- [x] Mithril chain-linking + AVK binding (DoD line 4, part 2 of N, PR #11):
      `src/mithril.rs::verify_chain` walks a cert segment oldest→newest checking
      each cert's integrity (`compute_hash == hash`), `previous_hash` linkage, and
      the AVK binding (child AVK == the `next_aggregate_verification_key` the parent
      committed one epoch earlier). Non-vacuous negatives (broken link / reorder /
      splice / tamper / AVK-substitution); feature-gate clean (0 blst in default+wasm).
- [x] Mithril GENESIS ANCHOR (DoD line 4, part 3 of N): the trust root the chain
      terminates in. `src/mithril.rs::verify_genesis(cert, genesis_vkey)` requires
      the cert be a genesis cert (carries a genesis signature), that its
      `signed_message` binds its protocol message (`signed_message ==
      protocol_message.compute_hash()`, so the signature transitively commits the
      genesis AVK), and that the 64-byte Ed25519 `genesis_signature` verifies under
      the pinned per-network genesis vkey over `signed_message.as_bytes()` (the ASCII
      hex) on Sextant's own libsodium-strict `ed25519::verify`. New `tools/harvest
      mithril-genesis` walks tip→genesis (release-preprod re-genesis is at epoch 196,
      105 hops), checking in ONLY the genesis cert (`mithril-genesis-cert.json` hash
      `69bc3bdf…af7ad59`), its immediate child (`mithril-genesis-child.json`), and the
      decoded genesis vkey (`mithril-genesis.vkey` = `7f497ca1…cd27eb2c`). Proven: the
      real genesis cert verifies, verdict byte-identical to pallas-crypto's
      independent (cryptoxide) Ed25519 on the same (vkey, msg, sig); the message
      format was empirically pinned (only `signed_message.as_bytes()` verifies, not
      the 32 raw bytes); tampered sig / wrong vkey / swapped protocol message / a
      standard cert / malformed sig each reject with a distinct verdict; and
      `verify_chain([genesis, child])` accepts — the genesis root authorizes the next
      epoch's signer set (one hop of the chain of trust). No new crate (reuses
      `ed25519`); Cargo.lock adds 0; mithril feature keeps it out of default+wasm.
      STM multi-sig verify + the full tip→genesis walk close the DoD line.
- [x] Mithril STANDARD-cert STM multi-signature verify (DoD line 4, part 4 of N):
      `src/mithril.rs::verify_standard(cert)` authorizes a *standard* certificate by
      its stake-based threshold multi-signature. Sextant owns the wire path — hex→JSON
      deserialize of `aggregate_verification_key`
      (`AggregateVerificationKeyForConcatenation` → `AggregateVerificationKey::new`) and
      `multi_signature` (`AggregateSignature`), `Parameters{m,k,phi_f}` assembly from the
      cert metadata, and the `signed_message == protocol_message.compute_hash()` binding
      (the shared guard, now factored and reused by `verify_genesis`) — and COMPOSES
      `mithril-stm` 0.10.5 (`num-integer-backend`, off wasm) for the BLS aggregate /
      lottery-eligibility / Merkle-batch verify over `signed_message.as_bytes()`, exactly
      as `curve25519-dalek` is composed for the header VRF. All 12 real preprod standard
      multi-signatures verify; wrong message / wrong AVK → `InvalidMultiSignature`, swapped
      protocol message → `MessageMismatch`, genesis cert → `NotStandard`, malformed blobs →
      `MalformedAvk`/`MalformedSignature`. mithril-stm is the sole STM implementation, so
      the oracle is the real on-chain multi-signatures themselves (unforgeable threshold
      BLS), not a second library. Feature-gated: `cargo tree -e normal` shows 0
      blst/mithril-stm in default+wasm. The full tip→genesis walk (`verify_chain_anchored`)
      composing genesis + AVK-binding + per-cert `verify_standard` is part 5 (closes DoD line 4).
- [x] Mithril GENESIS-ANCHORED WALK (DoD line 4, part 5 of 5 — CLOSES the line):
      `src/mithril.rs::verify_chain_anchored(certs, genesis_vkey)` composes the three
      verifiers built across parts 2–4 into one bytes-in/verdict-out control flow — the
      segment's integrity + hash-linkage + AVK-binding (`verify_chain`), the root as the
      network genesis anchor (`verify_genesis`), and every rising cert's STM multi-signature
      (`verify_standard`) — returning the verified root/tip hashes or the offending cert's
      index (`AnchoredError::{Chain,Genesis,Standard}`). Proven on the real preprod segment
      rooted in the epoch-196 re-genesis (`[genesis, child]`, tip hash `fc979366…f2d56b72`);
      negatives (empty / wrong genesis vkey / non-genesis root / broken link / naive-integrity
      tamper / substituted AVK / tampered authority) each reject at the right layer + index.
      Integrity runs first, so a parameter-weakened forgery can't reach the multi-sig verify.
      Two part-4 red-team hardening items landed in `verify_standard`: (1) a degenerate-threshold
      guard (`k==0`/`m==0`/`phi_f∉(0,1]` → `WeakParameters`); (2) `guard_stm_bounds` closing
      TWO real mithril-stm DoS vectors the hostile-input tests surfaced — a signer claiming
      more stake than `total_stake` (eligibility Taylor series never converges) and `nr_leaves`
      near the u64 overflow (Merkle verify never terminates), both → `ImplausibleAvk` promptly.
      No new crate (composes existing ed25519/mithril-stm); mithril feature keeps it out of
      default+wasm.

## Constraints
- Read-path only. No transaction building, no interface layer — that
  belongs to the separate write-path layer this library sits under.
- Rust core. pallas crates permitted as dependencies, but every verdict
  this library returns must be computed by its own code path and
  differentially tested — never delegated to an RPC.
- No trusted oracle in the verify path: Dolos/Blockfrost may supply
  bytes, never verdicts.
- Targets: static lib + C ABI (cbindgen), wasm32. Keep the core no_std-friendly where feasible.
- Zig embedding layer is out of scope until the Rust core's DoD is green.

## Merge policy
- Auto-merge: yes. Merge requires all of: CI harness check green,
  red-team VERDICT: SHIP, no unresolved review threads.
- Method: squash; delete branch on merge; sync default branch after.
- Merge-triggers-deploy repos: n/a (library; releases tag manually until
  the Live line is close).
- Standing authorizations: starting scripts/loop.sh for Plan items in
  this file needs no further approval.

## Notes for the next iteration
State (2026-07-11): **Mithril GENESIS-ANCHORED WALK shipped — DoD line 4 is CLOSED**
(part 5 of 5). `src/mithril.rs::verify_chain_anchored(certs, genesis_vkey)` is the read
path's trust terminus: given a genesis-anchored segment (oldest first), it composes the
three verifiers built across parts 2–4 into one bytes-in/verdict-out control flow —
`verify_chain` (integrity + hash-linkage + AVK-binding over the whole segment, run FIRST
so each cert's `k/m/phi_f`/AVK is pinned to its committed hash before any signature work),
`verify_genesis` (the root is the network genesis anchor), and `verify_standard` per rising
cert (its STM multi-signature). Returns the verified root/tip hashes or the offending cert's
position (`AnchoredError::{Chain(ChainError), Genesis(GenesisError), Standard{index,source}}`).
Proven on the real preprod segment `[genesis(196), child(197)]` (tip hash `fc979366…f2d56b72`);
every negative rejects at the right layer + index. **The genesis-anchored segment is length 2**
(the epoch-196 re-genesis + its epoch-197 child) — a genuine, contiguous, aggregator-fetched
chain terminating in the genesis root; the at-scale multi-cert machinery is proven separately
(part 2 `verify_chain` over the 12-cert epoch-290→300 run in `tests/mithril_chain.rs`; part 4
`verify_standard` over 12 standard STM sigs). A longer contiguous genesis→…→tip harvest
(`tools/harvest mithril-chain`) is a strengthening the operator can run when the aggregator is
reachable, NOT a DoD gap. No new crate (composes existing `ed25519` + `mithril-stm`); mithril
feature keeps it out of default+wasm.

**Both part-4 red-team hardening items landed in `verify_standard` — and the hostile-input
tests SURFACED REAL mithril-stm DoS vectors (a first red-team pass returned BLOCK; now closed):**
1. **Parameter integrity** — a fail-closed `k==0`/`m==0`/`phi_f∉(0,1)` guard → `WeakParameters`.
   `phi_f=1.0` is REJECTED (the first red-team's MEDIUM): it makes every claimed lottery win, so a
   lone signer clears the k-quorum. Independent of `verify_chain`'s integrity check, which also
   pins the params.
2. **Adversarial serde-input** — `guard_stm_bounds(avk_json, sig_json)` + blob-size caps close
   every way hostile AVK/sig bytes drive stock mithril-stm into unbounded work (a thread-timeout
   probe CONFIRMED the hangs >12s; guarded, <20ms) → `ImplausibleAvk`/`Malformed*`: a signer
   claiming `stake > total_stake` (eligibility Taylor exponent >1 diverges), `nr_leaves ∉ [1,2²⁴]`
   (Merkle arithmetic overflows near 2⁶⁴), `signatures.len() > 2¹⁶`, total lottery `indexes > 2¹⁸`
   (the first red-team's HIGH — mithril-stm evaluates one lottery per index BEFORE checking the
   count against `k`), and AVK/sig hex blobs > 4 MiB (bounds `serde_json` allocation). All bounds
   are ~10²–10³× any real Cardano certificate. `verify_standard_rejects_hostile_stm_inputs` asserts
   each is a prompt clean `Err` via a 10s-bounded worker thread, so a guard regression fails cleanly
   instead of hanging the suite. In a chain walk the AVK is additionally pinned by AVK-binding; the
   guard makes standalone `verify_standard` safe on fully-untrusted bytes.

**Carried LOW (re-red-team, non-blocking):** `MAX_STM_BLOB_HEX = 4 MiB` has the thinnest
headroom of the four DoS caps vs a large mainnet `CardanoTransactions` aggregate (~1–2 MB
observed). It is fail-closed (a bigger genuine cert → `MalformedSignature`, never a
false-accept/panic/hang), and the target here is preprod (kilobyte certs). When a mainnet cert
harvest lands (same tooling as the block harvest, needs network), measure the largest genuine sig
blob and raise the constant to a few × above it (8–16 MiB).

**Attacking next — DoD line 5: UTxO verification for the read path (design slice first).**
The DoD says: decide snapshot-anchored vs proof-based in a design slice, then implement, with a
negative test proving a tampered UTxO claim is rejected. The Mithril chain of trust just closed
is the natural anchor: a Mithril snapshot certificate's `protocol_message` commits (via
`SnapshotDigest` / `CardanoTransactionsMerkleRoot`) to signed Cardano state, and
`verify_chain_anchored` now authenticates that certificate back to the genesis key. So a
snapshot-anchored UTxO proof = (a Merkle/inclusion proof that a UTxO is in the committed set) +
(the committing certificate verified by `verify_chain_anchored`). First slice = DESIGN: pick the
proof shape mithril's `CardanoTransactions`/immutable-file snapshot actually exposes, and how a
UTxO-set inclusion binds to a certificate's `SnapshotDigest`/merkle root. Then a slice implementing
it with the tampered-claim negative. Header VRF/KES from-mainnet (DoD line 2) remains a separate
open tick — it needs a real-mainnet block harvest with eta0 (see the DoD line 2 assessment below).

Prior state (2026-07-11): **Mithril STANDARD-cert STM multi-signature verify shipped**
(DoD line 4, part 4). `src/mithril.rs::verify_standard(cert)` authorizes a standard certificate
by its STM (stake-based threshold multi-signature): the cert must be standard, `signed_message
== protocol_message.compute_hash()` (the **shared guard** `signed_message_binds_protocol_message`,
reused by `verify_genesis`), and `mithril_stm::AggregateSignature::verify` succeeds over
`signed_message.as_bytes()`. Sextant owns the wire path (hex→JSON AVK/sig deserialize +
`Parameters{m,k,phi_f}` assembly); the BLS aggregate/lottery/Merkle-batch check is the composed
`mithril-stm` 0.10.5 primitive (`num-integer-backend`, NEVER rug/snark), `D = MithrilMembershipDigest`.
**mithril-stm is the sole STM implementation**, so the oracle is the 12 real on-chain multi-sigs
themselves. Feature-gated: `cargo tree -e normal` shows 0 blst/mithril-stm in default+wasm.

Prior state (2026-07-11): **Mithril GENESIS ANCHOR shipped** (DoD line 4, part 3 of N).
`src/mithril.rs::verify_genesis(cert, &genesis_vkey)` verifies the chain's trust
root: it requires the cert be a genesis cert (`is_genesis` = non-empty
`genesis_signature`), that `signed_message == protocol_message.compute_hash()` (so
the signature transitively commits the genesis AVK — a swapped protocol message is
rejected `MessageMismatch`), and that the 64-byte Ed25519 `genesis_signature`
verifies under the pinned per-network genesis vkey over `signed_message.as_bytes()`
(the ASCII hex, NOT the 32 raw bytes — empirically pinned) on Sextant's own
libsodium-strict `ed25519::verify`. Reuses the existing ed25519 substrate — **no
new crate, Cargo.lock adds 0**, all under the `mithril` feature (out of default +
wasm). `tools/harvest mithril-genesis` walked tip→genesis (release-preprod
**re-genesis is at epoch 196**, 105 hops) and checked in only the genesis cert
(`mithril-genesis-cert.json`, hash `69bc3bdf…af7ad59`), its immediate child
(`mithril-genesis-child.json`), and the decoded genesis vkey (`mithril-genesis.vkey`
= `7f497ca1…cd27eb2c`, the mithril-repo published key, reviewed in-PR). Proven on
the real cert: verifies, verdict byte-identical to pallas-crypto's independent
cryptoxide Ed25519; five distinct rejections; and `verify_chain([genesis, child])`
Ok — the genesis root authorizes the next epoch's signer set (one hop). Message
binding is included defensively (matches mithril intent: `signed_message` IS the
protocol-message hash); a red-team should confirm mithril-common's genesis verify
is no stricter.

**Attacking next — DoD line 4, part 4: STM multi-signature verify** (then part 5:
the full tip→genesis walk that closes the line). The genesis anchor is the root for
*genesis* certs; every *standard* cert rides on an STM multi-signature over its
`signed_message` under its AVK. Compose `mithril-stm` (see the "Attacking next"
block below for the exact feature flags — `num-integer-backend`, NEVER `rug`/`snark`;
blst `portable`), implement `verify_standard` (multi-sig verify + AVK-binding +
`signed_message == protocol_message.compute_hash()`), oracle = `mithril-common`'s
`ProtocolMultiSignature::verify`. Keep it under the `mithril` feature so blst stays
out of wasm. NOTE: the `verify_genesis` message-binding check is exactly the
standard-cert `signed_message`↔`protocol_message` check — factor the shared guard
when part 4 lands (avoid a second copy). The 12 `mithril-cert-*.json` standard-cert
vectors already carry real `multi_signature` blobs to verify against.

Prior state (2026-07-11): **Mithril certificate HASHING shipped** (DoD line 4, part 1
of N). `src/mithril.rs` (behind the OFF-by-default `mithril` cargo feature)
decodes an aggregator certificate on Sextant's own path and recomputes its
content hash byte-exactly to `mithril-common`: the four nested SHA-256 hashes
(`ProtocolParameters` with `k`/`m` BE-u64 + `phi_f` as a `U8F24` round-ties-even
`u32`; `CertificateMetadata` with chrono BE-i64 nanosecond timestamps + per-signer
`party_id‖BE(stake)`; `ProtocolMessage` iterated in `ProtocolMessagePartKey`
**enum order**, not JSON order; `Certificate` feeding the wire avk/multi_sig/
genesis_sig strings directly, standard-cert path binding `signed_entity_type`).
Proven on 12 real preprod certs (`cargo run -p harvest mithril`, aggregator
`release-preprod`) — all match the aggregator's own committed `hash`, and each
`previous_hash` is the parent's recomputed hash — plus mithril-common's own unit
goldens (`ace019…`, `f16631…`, phi_f 0.7→11744051). Feature-gated so the default
+ wasm graph is unchanged (**Cargo.lock adds 0 crates**; serde/serde_json/chrono
were already resolved via existing dev-deps).

**Design point (a) — tip→genesis walk depth — RESOLVED by the part-3 harvest.**
The walk is NOT hundreds of hops: release-preprod **re-genesised at epoch 196**, so
genesis is reached in 105 hops from the current tip (not near epoch 0). `tools/harvest
mithril-genesis` does the full walk once, checking in only the genesis cert + child +
vkey; the aggregator retains the chain that far, no pruning hit. So the full-walk path
(not the bounded-segment alternative) is what part 5 composes — the harvest tool
already proves it's tractable. **Design point (b) — STM multi-sig — still open** (part
4): pulls `mithril-stm`+blst, keep under the `mithril` feature (off in wasm); add
`apt-get install -y clang` to CI only if Mithril-in-wasm is later wanted.
`SignedEntityType` / `ProtocolMessagePartKey` model only the variants seen in real
vectors — a cert with another tag is a clean deserialize error, extend with its own
vector then.

Prior state (2026-07-11): **REAL BOUNDARY shipped — DoD line 3 is CLOSED** (slice
9, part 3 of 3). `cargo run -p harvest boundary` (new mode in `tools/harvest`)
BlockFetched a contiguous 10-block preprod run across the epoch 299→300 turn
(slots 127958330..=127958607, turn at 127958489) into `boundary-<slot>.block` +
per-epoch `.eta0` sidecars: the last epoch-299 block (127958384) carries η0(299)
`9adf4f5b…f4e0b2`, the first epoch-300 block (127958489) carries η0(300)
`aa845533…4eeb6c30` — the same evolved value part 2 pinned. `tests/boundary.rs`
splits the run at its single nonce switch and, reusing `chain::verify_segment`
once per side, proves: each side verifies against ITS epoch nonce; the boundary
links by hash (last-299 `block_hash` == first-300 `prev_hash`, `+1` height, slot
advances); and swapping in the WRONG epoch's nonce makes leader-VRF reject at
block 0 on BOTH sides. **No `src/` change** — the per-epoch nonce switch is a
test-level composition of the existing primitive, so no single-caller abstraction
was added. The `boundary-` prefix isolates these from part 2's single-epoch
preprod sweep, while the all-`*.block` decode + VRF-output sweeps auto-verify them
against pallas.

**DoD line 3 (Chain following across an epoch boundary, incl. nonce evolution) is
now checked**, PROVEN on preprod — the operator-chosen testnet for this whole
client (Plan line 46). The "preview" wording in line 3 is the documented
preprod substitution, not an unmet requirement; the evolved η0(300) is named in
the test. DoD line 3 parts 1 (formula, `src/nonce.rs`) + 2 (single-epoch chain,
`src/chain.rs`) + 3 (this real boundary) are all shipped.

Prior state (2026-07-11): **Nonce-evolution FORMULA shipped** (DoD line 3
part 1). `src/nonce.rs` exposes `combine(a,b)` (`⭒` = `Blake2b256(a‖b)`),
`block_nonce_contribution(&[u8;64])` (`Blake2b256(Blake2b256(0x4E‖vrf))`),
`evolve(&eta_v, &vrf_output)` (rolling fold) and `epoch_nonce(candidate,
prevHashNonce, Option<&[u8;32]> extra_entropy)` (epoch combine). All alloc-free
fixed-buffer over the shared `hash::blake2b256`; `pallas-crypto`'s `nonce` module
is the dev-only oracle (its `generate_epoch_nonce` IS `⭒`; its
`generate_rolling_nonce(prev,x)=Blake2b256(prev‖Blake2b256(x))` reproduces the
Praos fold when fed `Blake2b256(0x4E‖vrf)`). Trust-substrate normal-dep graph
unchanged. **Formula only** — no chain data consumed yet; the prevHashNonce
retag, candidate-freeze window, and a real epoch fold are parts 2 + 3.

Prior state (2026-07-11): KES body-signature verify shipped. DoD line 2's two
crypto halves — leader-VRF (slice 4) and KES (opcert slice 5 + KES body-sig slice
6) — are both proven on the 22 real preprod vectors, each byte-identical to an
independent pallas-family oracle.

`src/kes.rs` now exposes, beyond opcert: `verify_kes(root_vkey, period, msg,
&[u8;448]) -> Result<(), KesError>` (recursive `Sum6Kes`: depth-6 Blake2b256 vk
tree over `ed25519::verify` leaves, `sig = sigma(d−1) ‖ vk0 ‖ vk1`, split at
`2^(d−1)`), and `verify_header_kes(&HeaderView)` which derives the evolution
period `slot/129600 − opcert.kes_period` (checked_sub + `<64` bound, else
`KesPeriodOutOfRange`). `HeaderView` gained `header_body: Vec<u8>` (the raw CBOR
span the KES key signs, captured `body_start..d.position()`) and
`body_signature: [u8;448]`. `blake2b256` is now shared in `src/hash.rs` (vrf's
`praos_vrf_input` and kes's vk tree both call it). Oracle: `pallas-crypto` dev-dep
now `features=["kes"]` → `pallas_crypto::kes::summed_kes::Sum6KesSig::verify` — an
independent `Sum6Kes` implementation. The `kes` feature pulls dev-only mainstream
transitives (serde_with/schemars/chrono/time); `cargo tree -p sextant --edges
normal` confirms the trust-substrate lib graph is unchanged (4 direct deps).

**DoD line 2 assessment — deliberately left unchecked.** Line 2 asks for VRF+KES
on ≥20 golden vectors "pulled from preview and mainnet." What is proven: leader-VRF
+ KES on 22 **preprod** blocks (freshly BlockFetched off a live relay), oracle-
parity on each. What is NOT proven for a fully honest tick: (a) the leader-VRF
verify runs preprod-only because mainnet vectors have no `.eta0` sidecar; (b) the
5 mainnet vectors are pallas **synthetic decode-fixtures** — the diagnostic this
slice ran shows babbage1/2/3 carry hand-set slots (~1.03M, impossible for real
Babbage) whose slot→KES-period relationship is off by a constant, so
`verify_header_kes` (which derives the period from the slot) cannot use them;
babbage4 (slot 63.5M) and conway1 obey the formula and DO match the oracle's
period exactly (27, 5) — confirming the period math and the KES verifier, not a
bug. A clean line-2 tick needs a **real-mainnet block harvest with eta0**
(same tooling as the preprod harvest). Recorded here so the operator, not the
loop, decides whether preprod-primary satisfies line 2.

Prior state: operational-certificate verify (slice 5, PR #5, `32d50b4`).
`src/ed25519.rs` exposes `verify(pubkey, msg, sig) -> bool` (libsodium strict
cofactorless). `src/kes.rs` exposes `opcert_signable`/`verify_opcert`. `HeaderView`
carries `opcert` (header_body idx 8). `src/curve.rs` `decode_point` is shared by
vrf and ed25519.

Earlier state: full leader-VRF **verify** on Sextant's own draft-03 code path.
`src/vrf.rs` exposes `verify(vkey, alpha, proof)`, `verify_praos_leader(vkey,
slot, eta0, proof)` (builds `alpha = Blake2b256(BE64(slot)‖eta0)` via
`praos_vrf_input`) and `proof_to_hash`. All 22 preprod vectors carry a
`preprod-<slot>.eta0` sidecar (epoch-300 nonce); every real leader proof
verifies + matches the independent `cardano-crypto` oracle; tampered
slot/nonce/key/scalar reject.

**Substrate migrated cryptoxide → Amaru `curve25519-dalek` fork**
(`package = "amaru-curve25519-dalek"`, aliased `curve25519-dalek`,
`default-features=false, ["u64_backend","alloc"]`) + `sha2 0.9` + `blake2 0.9`.
Why: Elligator2 hash-to-curve must match libsodium byte-for-byte, and cryptoxide
exposes neither its field ops (mul/sq/from_bytes are private) nor a general
variable-base Edwards mul, so it cannot host the map or the `U`/`V` equations.
Upstream dalek's `hash_from_bytes` uses the wrong sign bit; Amaru's fork is a
single-commit fix (`sign_bit = 0`) and is what the Amaru node itself runs.
cryptoxide is fully removed — `proof_to_hash` is now `gamma.mul_by_cofactor()`
(no more −P negate hack), still byte-identical on all 27 vectors. wasm32 build
confirmed green with the fork.

Trust note for the red-team / Live slice: **eta0 is a byte input, not a trusted
verdict.** A wrong eta0 changes alpha, so it can only make a genuine proof
*reject* (liveness), never make an invalid proof *accept* (safety holds). In the
tests eta0 is self-authenticating — the 22 real proofs verifying is proof the
Koios nonce was correct. For a live consumer, the trust-minimal source of eta0
is to **compute** it from the chain (the separate nonce-evolution DoD line):
eta0 evolves deterministically from block VRF outputs. That slice makes the
whole leader-VRF path oracle-free.

## Attacking next — DoD line 4: Mithril genesis-anchored certificate-chain verify
Protocol independently derived from the mithril source (mithril-common 0.6.67 +
mithril-stm 0.10.5) and validated against a LIVE preprod certificate
(spec-derivation workflow, confidence HIGH). USE THIS.

COMPOSE the STM primitive, IMPLEMENT the chain-walk yourself (bytes-in/verdict-out):
- Compose `mithril-stm = { version = "0.10.5", default-features = false,
  features = ["num-integer-backend"] }` for the multi-sig verify only. NEVER
  enable `rug-backend` or `future_snark` (rug = GMP, breaks wasm). It rides blst
  `portable` (off-x86 OK). Differential oracle: `mithril-common` (dev-only) —
  its `CertificateVerifier::verify_certificate_chain`.
- Implement in `src/mithril.rs`: entity structs (Certificate, CertificateMetadata,
  ProtocolMessage = ordered map keyed by a ProtocolMessagePartKey enum,
  ProtocolParameters{k,m,phi_f}, CertificateSignature{ Genesis(hex) |
  Multi(SignedEntityType, json-hex) }); the 4 byte-exact SHA-256 hash fns
  (ProtocolParameters.compute_hash uses a U8F24 fixed-point `phi_f =
  round(phi_f*2^24) as u32-BE` — inline ~5 lines, do NOT pull `fixed`; golden
  check phi_f=0.7 -> 11744051; metadata: chrono RFC3339 nanoseconds as i64-BE;
  ProtocolMessage iterates in enum order; Certificate.compute_hash feeds the wire
  avk/multi_sig strings DIRECTLY, no re-serialize); the chain-walk (tip -> genesis
  via `previous_hash`) as Sextant control flow with an injected
  `get_certificate(prev_hash)` retriever (lib stays offline/sync; harvester/test
  supplies fetched bytes).
- GENESIS ANCHORING (the trust root, the crux): the walk terminates at a GENESIS
  cert whose `genesis_signature` is Ed25519 by the per-network GENESIS
  VERIFICATION KEY over the genesis AVK. Reuse `src/ed25519.rs` (gate to match
  mithril verify_strict). Fetch the preprod genesis vkey, pin it as a vector.
- AVK BINDING (chain of trust): each cert's protocol_message carries
  `NextAggregateVerificationKey` = next epoch's AVK; verify the CHILD cert's own
  `aggregate_verification_key` == what the PARENT signed, recursively to the
  genesis AVK. Plus previous_hash / epoch chaining as pure comparisons.
- STANDARD cert = STM multi-sig verify (`ProtocolMultiSignature::verify(
  signed_message, avk, params)` via mithril-stm) + AVK-binding + linking. GENESIS
  cert = Ed25519 genesis-sig. Follow 0.6.67 verify_standard (10 steps) /
  verify_genesis (5 steps) ordering.

WASM (harness gates `cargo build --target wasm32` — must stay green):
RECOMMENDED — put the Mithril verifier + `mithril-stm` behind a cargo feature
(`mithril`, OFF by default). `cargo test/clippy --all-features` exercise it on the
host (with the mithril-common oracle); the default lib build + the wasm build
EXCLUDE it, so the wasm artifact stays lean and dodges blst's wasm C-toolchain
(clang) need entirely. The harness already uses `--all-features` for test/clippy
and plain for the wasm build, so this composes cleanly. (Alt if you want Mithril
IN wasm: add `apt-get install -y clang` to `.woodpecker/harness.yml` + under
`cfg(target_family="wasm")` set `getrandom = {version="0.2", features=["js"]}` —
IOG's mithril-client-wasm proves blst->wasm works with clang.)

HARVEST + DoD proof: extend `tools/harvest` to fetch a real preprod certificate
CHAIN from the aggregator (base `https://aggregator.pre-release-preview.api.
mithril.network/aggregator` — CONFIRM; GET /certificates, /certificate/{hash},
walk `previous_hash` to a genesis cert) + the preprod genesis vkey; check them in
as JSON vectors. DoD line 4 proof = a test that verifies the chain to genesis and
NAMES the certificate hash; negatives (tampered multi-sig / broken previous_hash /
wrong genesis vkey / mismatched NextAVK) each reject; verdict byte-identical to
mithril-common's verifier.

Infra: Woodpecker CI green through pipeline 75; trust-substrate normal-dep graph
otherwise unchanged (feature-gate keeps mithril-stm out of the default/wasm graph).
